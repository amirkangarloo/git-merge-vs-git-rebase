# Git Merge VS Git Rebase

## Which is better merge or rebase?
Merging is a safe option that preserves the entire history of your repository, while rebasing creates a linear history by moving your feature branch onto the tip of main.

## Should I use git rebase or git merge?
In which situations should we use a rebase ? Use rebase whenever you want to add changes of a base branch back to a branched out branch. Typically, you do this in feature branches whenever there's a change in the main branch.

## Why you should never rebase in git?
Rebasing can be dangerous! Rewriting history of shared branches is prone to team work breakage. This can be mitigated by doing the rebase/squash on a copy of the feature branch, but rebase carries the implication that competence and carefulness must be employed
